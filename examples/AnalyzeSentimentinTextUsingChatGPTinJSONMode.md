# Analyze Sentiment in Text Using ChatGPT™ in JSON Mode

To run the code shown on this page, open the MLX file in MATLAB®: [mlx-scripts/AnalyzeSentimentinTextUsingChatGPTinJSONMode.mlx](mlx-scripts/AnalyzeSentimentinTextUsingChatGPTinJSONMode.mlx) 

This example shows how to use ChatGPT for sentiment analysis and output the results in JSON format. 


To run this example, you need a valid API key from a paid OpenAI™ API account.

```matlab
loadenv(".env")
addpath('../..')
```

Define some text to analyze the sentiment.

```matlab
inputText = ["I can't stand homework.";
    "This sucks. I'm bored.";
    "I can't wait for Halloween!!!";
    "I am neigher for or against the idea.";
    "My cat is adorable ❤️❤️";
    "I hate chocolate"];
```

Define the expected output JSON Schema.

```matlab
jsonSchema = '{"sentiment": "string (positive, negative, neutral)","confidence_score": "number (0-1)"}';
```

Define the the system prompt, combining your instructions and the JSON Schema. In order for the model to output JSON, you need to specify that in the prompt, for example, adding *"designed to output to JSON"*  to the prompt.

```matlab
systemPrompt = "You are an AI designed to output to JSON. You analyze the sentiment of the provided text and  " + ...
    "Determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral and provide a confidence score using " + ...
    "the schema: " + jsonSchema;
prompt = "Analyze the sentiment of the provided text. " + ...
    "Determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative," + ...
    " or neutral and provide a confidence score";
```

Create a chat object with `ModelName gpt-3.5-turbo` and specify `ResponseFormat` as `"json".`

```matlab
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo";
chat = openAIChat(systemPrompt, ModelName=model, ResponseFormat="json");
```

```matlabTextOutput
Warning: When using JSON mode, you must also prompt the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message.
```

Concatenate the prompt and input text and generate an answer with the model.

```matlab
scores = cell(1,numel(inputText));
for i = 1:numel(inputText)
```

Generate a response from the message. 

```matlab
    [json, message, response] = generate(chat,prompt + newline + newline + inputText(i));
    scores{i} = jsondecode(json);
end
```

Extract the data from the JSON ouput. 

```matlab
T = struct2table([scores{:}]);
T.text = inputText;
T = movevars(T,"text","Before","sentiment")
```
